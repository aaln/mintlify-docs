<Note>
  Results are paginated. Use `limit` and `offset` parameters to navigate through results.
</Note>

## Usage

Get a list of all documents with optional filtering by status. The response includes pagination information to help you navigate through large result sets.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.slct.ai/api/documents?limit=10&status=completed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

## Filtering

You can filter documents by their processing status:

- `created` - Document registered but not yet uploaded
- `uploading` - File upload in progress
- `processing` - Document being processed
- `completed` - Processing finished successfully
- `failed` - Processing encountered an error

```typescript
// Using the Node.js client
const client = new SlctClient('your-api-key');

const { documents, pagination } = await client.listDocuments({
  status: 'completed',
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0
});
```

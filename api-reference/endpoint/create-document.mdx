title: 'Create Document'
openapi: 'POST /api/documents/new'
---

<Note>
  For files larger than 5MB, you'll need to perform a multipart upload using the returned signed URLs.
</Note>

## Usage

Create a new document and get upload details. For large files, the response includes signed URLs for multipart upload.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.slct.ai/api/documents/new" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file_size": 1048576,
    "parts": 1,
    "metadata": {
      "customerRef": "12345"
    }
  }'
```

## File Upload Process

1. Create document and get upload details
2. Use signed URLs to upload file parts
3. Document processing begins automatically
4. Monitor status through the GET endpoint

```typescript
// Using the Node.js client
const client = new SlctClient('your-api-key');

const documentId = await client.uploadFile(
  file,
  { customerRef: '12345' },
  (progress) => {
    console.log(`${progress.loaded}/${progress.total} bytes`);
  }
);
```

## Metadata

You can attach custom metadata to your documents:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "customerRef": "12345",
    "department": "finance",
    "priority": "high",
    "tags": ["invoice", "urgent"]
  }
}
```
